# Multi-Classification-of-Retinal-Diseases-using-a-Pyramidal-Ensemble-Deep-Framework
This work introduces a multi-resolutional feature ensemble framework for retinal image classification. The proposed pyramidal layout allowed the designed architecture to extract various information to help in all-at-once classification of the four retinal disorders.
