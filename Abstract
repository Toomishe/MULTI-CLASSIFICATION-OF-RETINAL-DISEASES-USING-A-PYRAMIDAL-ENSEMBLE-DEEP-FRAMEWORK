Retinal disorders diagnosis is of immense importance for appropriate
treatment, i.e., accurate personalized medicine. In this work, a
multi-resolutional feature ensemble approach is developed for retinal
image classification using optical coherence tomography (OCT)
images. Particularly, feature-rich pipeline using pyramidal architecture
is designed to extract features from multi-scale inputs using
partially-connected networks (PCNet). In addition, higher-order reflectivity
features are extracted from the input images and are fused
with pyramidal features for retinal disorders diagnosis. The advantage
of the hierarchical PCNet structure is that it allowed our system
to extract multi-scale information to help in such task, all at once
classification of four retinal disorders. Namely, the larger input sizes
give more global information, while the small inputs focus on local
details. Evaluation on public OCT data sets of four classes (normal,
diabetic macular edema (DME), choroidal neovascularization
(CNV), and drusen) and comparison against recent networks demonstrates
not only the advantages of the proposed architectureâ€™s ability
to produce feature-rich classification, but also highlights tangible
advantages, such as network parameter reduction, enhanced feature
learning and information flow, while reducing the risk of over fitting.
